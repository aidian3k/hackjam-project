# Bid-Dolphin
Bid-Dolphin is a project prepared for the HackJam Hackathon based in Wroclaw Poland in November 2023. The task for our group was to create an application about live sales and
written/spoken language. The main aim of creating this project was to create the project using Artificial Intelligence. We came out with the idea of creating an app that would help
people sell small things like books/clothes etc. The app suggests a price based on the prices from the web and gives a short description of the product based only on the taken picture. In some cases, it is not accurate, but in most cases it is correct. The second feature of this project was creating a chat that interacts with the user and gives information about the auction. It supports multiple languages like Hindi, Polish, Spanish, English etc.

- Spring WebSockets
